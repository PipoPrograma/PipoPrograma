- 👀 I’m interested in One Piece
- 🌱 I’m currently learning One Piece
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on One Piece
- 📫 How to reach me One Piece
- One Piece 
- One Piece have the best worldbuilding
- One Piece is incredible
- The One Piece it's probably sake
- The One Piece does exist
- I think the episode 957 of One Piece is one of the best ones
- Also, the episode 982 is breathtaking
- Looking forward to watch the episode 1015 when it gets relased because Megumi Ishitani will direct it like the 957 or 982
- 14 is a great number, like One Piece
